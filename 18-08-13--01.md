# Interactive and contributed stories

## Concept

An interactive story, written by everyone! These stories are entirely built with `page`s, `string`s and `bead`s

Each `page` is owned by an user, contains some text describing a bit of the story. They may contain:

```
* ID
* metadata
  * date of creation
  * ...
* page content (text)
```

A `string` is a connection between two pages. They hold an `anchor ID`, a `target ID` and some text.

A `bead` is a bit of condition added to a `string`. This is their content:

```
* ID
* target ID
* anchor ID
* condition or gamestate modification
```

Lastly, we have `user`s:

```
* ID
* metadata (name, etc)
* state: Object/dictionary
* active ID: current page
```

## Formatting

This documentation uses `json` for the different example. Each object type is stored in its respective `Map`

## Page

Pages are the only objects which are owned. Only the owner (and admins in critical cases) should be able to modify it.

A `page` may look like this:

```json
{
  "id": "00000bf1",
  "meta": {
    "creation": "2018-08-13T16:50:02.986Z"
  },
  "owner": "0000d3c0",
  "content": "As Stella took a grasp at the beautiful landscape, she notices a blinking light from withing the trees of the other side of the fjord."
}
```

Both `id` and `owner` are hex numbers, stored as strings. The creation date is formatted according `ISO 8601 Extended Format`.

## String

Strings link two `page`s together.

```json
{
  "id": "00002c30",
  "anchor": "00000be6",
  "target": "00000bf1",
  "name": "notify-friends",
  "content": "Walk back and tell the discovery to your friends"
}
```

## Bead

Beads are attached on `string`s, and there can be as many as necessary. They both do actions and conditions.

```json
{
  "id": "000001b3",
  "string": "00002c30",
  "condition": "",
  "action": "register friends-aware-shining"
}
```

### Actions and Conditions

Both actions and conditions are an evaluated, high-level, soft-typed, language.

The syntax should be simple, and could look like this:

```js
verb noun1 noun2 ... nounN
verb (expression) noun2 ...
verb1 ...; verb2

variable_name = value
array = [value1, value2, value3]
object = [key1: value1, key2: value2]
string = "Hello world!"
string = '\'escaped\ncharacters\''
access_object = object.key1
access_object = object["key1"]
access_array = array[0]
number++
number--

if <condition> {verbs}
if <condition>, verb ...

for <condition>, <increment> {verbs}
for <condition>, <increment>, verb

while <condition> {verbs}
while <condition>, verb

// Condition syntax

value1 == value2
value1 != value2
value1 === value2
value1 !== value2
(verb ...)
<condition1> && <condition2>
<condition1> || <condition2>
!<condition>

// Expression syntax

a + b
a - b
a * b
a / b
a % b
(verb ...)
```

Common verbs are

* `register <key> [value]`: saves a value to the user's state, `value` defaults to true
* `unregister <key>`: removes one key from the user's state
* `registered <key>`: returns true if the given key was registered
* `grab <key>`: returns the value of a registered key, `null` if not registered

Verbs may also be childrens of global objects, `math` for instance

* `math.sqrt <num>`: returns the square root of `num`
* `math.pow <base> <exponent>`: returns `base` to the power `exponent`

An example of an use would be:

```
if (grab friends-aware-shining), unregister friends-aware-shining; register friends-saw-shining
```

Fibonacci:

```
a = 1; b = 1; n = 0; for n < 16, n++ {c = a; a = b; b = c + a}
```

## User

User objects represent one user's progress in the story. It allows the software to remember one's position and actions done.

```json
{
  "id": "0000d3c0",
  "name": "Shad",
  "state": {
    "friends-aware-shining": true
  },
  "position": "00000bf1",
  "actions": [
    "...",
    "notify-friends"
  ]
}
```
